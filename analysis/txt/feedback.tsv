31d30eea8d0968d6458e0ad0027c9f80	.98-20200529-survey_fixmax	Either words like Lemon Left or just from the practice. 	Mainly the colors like orange and purple or how I would normally not see them together like the pear and the coconut.	I was able to concentrate and it went pretty quick, it was just a little hard because I normally like say stuff to myself when I do the games so I remember but I was not as able to do that at home. 	It wasn't too hard and was fun.
